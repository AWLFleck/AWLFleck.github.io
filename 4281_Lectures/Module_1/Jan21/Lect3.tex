\section{Policy Transforms }
\begin{frame}{The Story So Far...} 

\begin{itemize}

\item So far we have looked at how to model insurance losses.

\vfill

\item Often this is \textit{exogenous} i.e. outside of our control.

\vfill

\item How can we control the cost/variably of claim losses?

\end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Deductible and Policy Limit}

  One way to control the cost (and variability) of individual claim losses is to introduce deductibles and policy limits.
  \vfill
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \alert{Deductible $d$}: the insurer starts paying when claim amounts exceed the deductible $d$
  \vfill
  \item \alert{Limit $L$}: the insurer pays up to the limit $L$.
  \end{itemize}
  \vfill
  If we denote the damage random variable by $D$, then if a claim occurs the insurer is liable for
  \begin{equation*}
    B=\min \left[ \max \left( D-d,0\right) ,L\right] \text{.}
  \end{equation*}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Numerical Example 1}
  Consider an automobile insurance where:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the policyholder has a probability $0.10$ of getting in an accident
  \item If an accident occurs, the damage to the vehicle is uniformly distributed between $0$ and $2\,500$.
  \item The policy has a deductible amount of $500$ and a policy limit of $1500$.
  \end{itemize}
  \vfill  
  
  Find:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The CDF and the probability density/mass function of $X$, the claim amount the insurer is liable for.
  \item The expected value of $X$.

\section{ Reinsurance }
\begin{frame}{Insurance for Insurance Companies?}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Insurance for Insurance Companies?}

Reinsurance is a contract wherin one company (the reinsurer) takes on the catastrohic risks of another insurer e.g.:

\begin{itemize}
\item Earthquakes and other disasters 

\item Industrial accidents 

\item Terrorism/war/riots

\item ....Aliens? (some losses are \textbf{very} difficult to anticipate)

\end{itemize}
\vfill
It is \alert{risk transfer} from an insurer (the direct writer) to a reinsurer: swap of deterministic against random. The risk that the insurer keeps is called the \alert{retention}.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}

In general there are two broad categories of Reinsurance "Treaties":
\vfill
\begin{itemize}

\item Random walk type (e.g. proportional, excess of loss, stop-loss). 

\vfill

\item Extreme value type (e.g. Largest claim, ExcÃ©dent du coÃ»t moyen relatif or ECOMOR).

\end{itemize}
\vfill
It is also worth noting the existence of things like \textit{Catastrophe Bonds}. 

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Reinsurance}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Proportional
    \begin{itemize}
    \item quota share: the proportion is the same for all risks
    \item surplus: the proportion can vary from risk to risk
    \end{itemize}
    \vfill
  \item Non-Proportional
    \begin{itemize}
    \item (individual) excess of loss: on each individual loss ($X_i$)
    \item stop loss: on the aggregate loss ($S$)
    \end{itemize}
    \vfill
  \item Cheap (reinsurance premium is the expected value), or \linebreak non cheap (reinsurance premium is loaded)
  %\item CAT bonds and the like...
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Proportional reinsurance}
  The \alert{retained proportion $\alpha$} defines who pays what:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the insurer pays $Y=\alpha X$
  \item the reinsurer pays $Z=(1-\alpha) X$
  \end{itemize}
  This is nothing else but a change of scale and we have
  $$\mu_Y=\alpha \mu_X,\;\;\;\sigma^2_Y=\alpha^2\sigma^2_X,\;\;\;\gamma_Y=\gamma_X.$$
  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Proportional reinsurance}
In some cases it suffices to adapt the scale parameter. For example if $X$ is exponential with parameter $\beta$:

\vfill

 $$\Pr[Y\le y]=\Pr[\alpha X \le y]=\Pr[X \le y/\alpha] = 1-e^{-\beta y / \alpha}$$
  
\vfill   
   
    ...and thus $Y$ is exponential with parameter $\beta/\alpha$.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[t]{Nonproportional reinsurance}
  \textbf{(Individual) Excess of Loss reinsurance} (EoL):
  \begin{itemize}
  \item For each individual loss $X$, the reinsurer pays the excess over a \alert{retention (excess point) $d$}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item the insurer pays $Y=\min(X,d)$
    \item the reinsurer pays $Z=(X-d)_+$
    \end{itemize}
  %  \item $E[(X-d)_+]$ is called \textbf{stop-loss premium}.
  \vfill
  \item in EoL, the reinsurer may limit his payments to an amount $L$. In that case
    \begin{itemize}
    \item the insurer pays $Y=\min(X,d)+(X-L-d)_+$
    \item the reinsurer pays $Z=\min\left\{(X-d)_+,L\right\}$
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
 
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Nonproportional reinsurance}
   \textbf{Stop loss reinsurance:} For aggregate loss $S$, the reinsurer pays the excess over a \alert{retention (excess point) $d$}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item the insurer pays $Y=\min(S,d)$
    \item the reinsurer pays $Z=(S-d)_+$
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{A useful identity}
   Note that
   $$\min(X,c)=X-(X-c)_+$$
   and thus
   $$E[\min(X,c)]=E[X]-E[(X-c)_+].$$
   
\vfill   
   
   The amount $E[(X-c)_+]$      
   \begin{itemize}
   \item is commonly called "stop loss premium" with retention $c$.
   \item is identical to the expected payoff of a call with strike price $c$, and thus results from financial mathematics can sometimes be directly used (and vice versa).
   \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Reinsurance premium}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Cheap reinsurance: Reinsurance premium equals to the expected value of random losses covered by the reinsurer
   
\vfill   
   
   \item Non-cheap reinsurance: Reinsurance premium equals to the expected value of random losses covered by the reinsurer plus a loading
   \end{itemize}

\textbf{Example} A life insurance company covers 16000 lives for 1-year term life insurance in amounts shown below\\

\begin{table}[]
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Benefit Amt (in 10,000s) & No. of lives covered \\ \hline
1                        & 8000                 \\ \hline
2                        & 3500                 \\ \hline
3                        & 2500                 \\ \hline
5                        & 1500                 \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The probability of a claim $q$ for each of the 16000 lives is 0.02. The excess of loss reinsurance with retention limit 30000 is available at a cost of 0.025 per dollar of coverage. Use the Normal approximation method to calculate the probability that the total cost will exceed $8250000$.
